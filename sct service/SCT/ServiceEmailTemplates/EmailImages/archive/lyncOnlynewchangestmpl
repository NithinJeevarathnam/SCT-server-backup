<h2 style='color:#0071c5;font-style: italic;'>Skype Softphone now available for use on your primary work phone {0}</h2>

<strong>Skype Softphone</strong> is now available for your use on your Intel number {0} (Inet) {1} (external). Skype Softphone is a fully functional telephone that runs on your computer. If you previously used a desk phone, it has now been disabled. In an emergency, please use another phone (desk, conference room or wall phone) or your cell phone.

<p>*If you are moving to a campus that uses a different INET prefix than the site you are moving phone, you will have received a new Intel phone number.  This is done in accordance to state law related to emergency call routing.</p>

<h3>Update Workday</h3>

Remember to update <a href='https://www.myworkday.com/intel/d/home.htmld'>Workday</a> with your Intel phone number. From Workday, navigate to Personal Information, then select Contact Information and from Edit select Change My Work Contact Information.

<h3>Headsets</h3>

IT does recommend headsets but, the purchase of the device is a department decision and is at the discretion of each manager. A list of recommended headsets can be found <a href='https://circuit.intel.com/content/it/products/hardware/headsets-main.html'>here</a>

<h3>Unified Messaging - Voicemail</h3>

<p>If your Exchange mailbox has not been migrated to Exchange Online (EXO), you can retrieve your voicemails and change your voicemail greeting using your current voicemail access number. Your voicemails are also available by opening the message in your Inbox. </p>

<p>If you are on Exchange Online (EXO), you have two options for retrieving your voicemails: The most convenient is to open the message in your Inbox and listen to the audio file. </p>

<p>The second option allows you to retrieve your voicemails as well as change your voicemail greeting:    From your Skype client select the dial pad icon and from voicemail select the down arrow </p>

<h3>Data Storage</h3>

<p>Just like our traditional phone system, we collect basic information about your calls such as the number you called, the number of the person calling you, and the length of the call. This data will be stored in a database in the US for one year. A restricted set of employees will have access to your Skype call history for the purpose of troubleshooting and traffic flow analysis.</p>
