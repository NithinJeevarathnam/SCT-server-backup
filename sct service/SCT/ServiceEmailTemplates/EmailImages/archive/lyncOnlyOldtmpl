<h2 style='color:#0071c5;font-style: italic;'>Skype Softphone now available for use on your primary work phone {0}</h2>

<strong>Skype Softphone</strong> is now available for your use on your Intel number {0} (Inet) {1} (external). Skype Softphone is a fully functional telephone that runs on your computer. If you previously used a desk phone, it has now been disabled. In an emergency, please use another phone (desk, conference room or wall phone) or your cell phone.

<p>*If you are moving to a campus that uses a different INET prefix than the site you are moving phone, you will have received a new Intel phone number.  This is done in accordance to state law related to emergency call routing.</p>

<h3>Update Workday</h3>

Remember to update <a href='https://www.myworkday.com/intel/d/home.htmld'>Workday</a> with your Intel phone number. From Workday, navigate to Personal Information, then select Contact Information and from Edit select Change My Work Contact Information.

<h3>Headsets</h3>

IT does recommend headsets but, the purchase of the device is a department decision and is at the discretion of each manager. A list of recommended headsets can be found <a href='https://circuit.intel.com/content/it/products/hardware/headsets-main.html'>here</a>

<h3>Unified Messaging - Voicemail</h3>

<p>The Unified Messaging access numbers should be consistent, but if there are any problems retrieving voicemails or changing your personal greeting please contact the TAC for Unified Messaging.</p>

<h3>Note to Cisco Softphone users</h3>

<p>After Skype Softphone is installed, you should uninstall Cisco SoftPhone on your PC. To do so, go to <strong>Control Panel > Uninstall program > Cisco IP Communicator</strong> and uninstall.</p>

<h3>Data Storage</h3>

<p>Just like our traditional phone system, we collect basic information about your calls such as the number you called, the number of the person calling you, and the length of the call. This data will be stored in a database in the US for one year. A restricted set of employees will have access to your Skype call history for the purpose of troubleshooting and traffic flow analysis.</p>

<p>For additional assistance or if you have questions, please contact the Technical Assistance Center (TAC). If you call, use Fast Path Code 974 for Telecom. You also can chat with an analyst, perform a search, or submit a service request at the <a href='http://it.intel.com/'>TAC website</a>.</p>
